## Contributing

We follow the "[fork-and-pull]" Git workflow.

  1. Fork the repo on GitHub
  1. Commit changes to a branch in your fork (use `snake_case` convention):
     - For technical chores, use `chore/` prefix followed by the short description, e.g. `chore/do_this_chore`
     - For new features, use `feature/` prefix followed by the feature name, e.g. `feature/feature_name`
     - For bug fixes, use `bug/` prefix followed by the short description, e.g. `bug/fix_this_bug`
  1. Rebase or merge from "upstream"
  1. Submit a PR "upstream" with your changes
